BEGAN: Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10717)

We propose a new equilibrium enforcing method paired with a loss derived from the Wasserstein distance for training auto-encoder based Generative Adversarial Networks.
This method balances the generator and discriminator during training.
Additionally, it provides a new approximate convergence measure, fast and stable training and high visual quality.
We also derive a way of controlling the trade-off between image diversity and visual quality.
We focus on the image generation task, setting a new milestone in visual quality, even at higher resolutions.
This is achieved while using a relatively simple model architecture and a standard training procedure.
